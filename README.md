# DIABETES PREDICTION APP
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin.
Here we have a machine learning app that uses logistic regression in backend to help detect diabetes.Also a dashboard was made using power BI for analysis.
